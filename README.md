# dwm

This is my personal build of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) by the guys over at suckless.org.

## patches
- restartsig to quickly restart dwm (Mod + CTRL + Shift + Q)
- fullgaps for easy gaps configurable by modifying the gappx int
- fixborders to fix translucent borders on st
- hide vacant tags to only display tags with applications open thereon
- underlinetags to underline the selected tag
